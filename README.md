## Overview

Shoshin is a social media platform dedicated to uniting gamers worldwide, providing a space where they can effortlessly share their experiences. Unlike other social media platforms, we focus exclusively on gaming-related content, ensuring the app remains free from unrelated distractions.

## Features

### Current Features
- **Profile Customization**: Allow everyone to customize their profile to their liking, including avatar decorations, banners, and custom CSS.
- **High-Grade Security**: We prioritize customer security first. Although we can't guarantee 100% protection, we'll do our best to keep your sensitive information secure and free from malicious behavior.
- **Friends**: We believe in friendships! You'll be able to add, remove, or even block other users at any given time. A friend will always be able to view your profile page, even if set to private in the account settings page. If your page is private, people who aren't friends with you won't be able to view it. Blocked users won't be able to find you on the social media platform at all.
- **Achievements**: Enjoy being rewarded for your activities? We’ve got you covered. Earn "Medals" as you use the app, which will be visible on your profile page and account settings page. Shine bright!
- **Linked Accounts**: Log in using third-party apps like Google or Discord. Set them up in the account settings page for seamless access.
- **Subscriptions**: While we aim to keep the app accessible for everyone, maintaining it comes at a cost. We've added a `Subscriptions` section where you can purchase any of the three available tiers, each offering unique benefits on the website.

### Upcoming / In Development
- **Various Tools**: Integrating tools related to different games, allowing users to take advantage of these resources within the social media platform.
- **Posting Videos Longer Than 30 Seconds**: Planning a specific section where you can post longer videos.
- **Direct Messages**: Developing a secure and private messaging system for users to communicate directly.
